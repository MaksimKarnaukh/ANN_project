# ANN_project

## Project Description

This project is a part of the course "Artificial Neural Networks" at the University of Antwerp.

## Running the code

In the src/ folder, you can find three jupyter notebook files, each one corresponding to a different part of the project. The notebooks are named as follows:

- main_fully_supervised.ipynb (fully supervised task)
- main_self_supervised_pipeline1.ipynb (pipeline 1)
- main_self_supervised_pipeline2.ipynb (pipeline 2)

The 15SceneData/ folder contains the train and test data for the fully supervised task.
